# Keyword-Nearest-Neighbor-algorithm-based-on-Rstar_tree

We analyzed a few Keyword cover algorithms for Big Data and implemented the efficient algorithm (Keyword Nearest Neighbor algorithm based on R*_tree) as a web application. The algorithm recommends the closest keyword search that considers inter-object distance and thekeyword rating of objects. We generalized the implementation to consider more dimensions. (We used real spatial data gathered from the Yelp dataset for testing)

For implementation of R*_tree we used the code implemented by [lokeshj](lokeshj.github.com/rstar-tree/)
